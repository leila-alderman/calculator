# Calculator

[This project](https://leila-alderman.github.io/calculator/) uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a functional browser calculator. The calculator accepts inputs and evaluates the expression following PEMDAS rules without using the [problematic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Do_not_ever_use_eval!) `eval()` JavaScript function. Its functionality includes a clear button, backspace button, and decimals that are limited to one per number. Additional functionality includes exponents and logic for parentheses. This calculator can also accept keyboard inputs. 

This is the [calculator project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator) from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).
